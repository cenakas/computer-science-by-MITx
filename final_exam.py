# problem 3
# McDonaldâ€™s sells Chicken McNuggets in packages of 6, 9 or 20 McNuggets. Thus, it is possible, for example, to buy exactly 15 McNuggets
# (with one package of 6 and a second package of 9), but it is not possible to buy exactly 16 McNuggets,
# since no non- negative integer combination of 6's, 9's and 20's add up to 16. To determine if it is possible to buy exactly n McNuggets,
# one has to find non-negative integer (can be 0) values of a, b, and c such that: y6a + 9b + 20c = n
# Write a function, called McNuggets that takes one argument, n, and returns True if it is possible to buy a combination of 6, 9
# and 20 pack units such that the total number of McNuggets equals n, and otherwise returns False. Hint: use a guess and check approach.

# problem 4
# Write a Python function that takes in two lists and calculates whether they are permutations of each other.
# The lists can contain both integers and strings. We define a permutation as follows:
# the lists have the same number of elements
# list elements appear the same number of times in both lists
# If the lists are not permutations of each other, the function returns False.  If they are permutations of each other,
# the function returns a tuple consisting of the following elements: the element occuring the most times, how many times that element occurs,
# the type of the element that occurs the most times
# If both lists are empty return the tuple (None, None, None). If more than one element occurs the most number of times, you can return any of them.
